# GKE 1.35 Migration Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for preparing your GKE clusters for version 1.35's ExecProbeTimeout enforcement.

## Timeline

### Week 1: Discovery & Assessment
- Deploy monitoring stack
- Identify affected workloads
- Prioritize critical services

### Week 2: Data Collection
- Collect probe execution metrics
- Monitor for at least 7 days
- Include peak traffic periods

### Week 3: Analysis & Planning
- Analyze P50, P95, P99 metrics
- Calculate recommended timeouts
- Create remediation plan

### Week 4: Implementation
- Test changes in staging
- Apply patches to production
- Monitor for issues

### Week 5: Validation
- Verify no increase in pod restarts
- Confirm service availability
- Sign-off for GKE upgrade

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Scenarios
1. Database health checks (2-5 seconds typical)
2. External API checks (network latency dependent)
3. Complex validation scripts (variable execution time)

### Mitigation Strategies
- Set conservative timeout values initially
- Use P99 + 20% buffer formula
- Monitor closely post-deployment

## Success Criteria

- Zero increase in pod restart rate
- Probe failure rate < 1%
- No service disruptions
- Response time within SLA

## Rollback Procedure

If issues occur:
1. Increase all timeoutSeconds to 30s immediately
2. Monitor for stabilization
3. Investigate root cause
4. Restore from backup if needed

## Support

- GKE Support: Via Google Cloud Console
- Community: Kubernetes Slack #gke channel
